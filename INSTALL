Only under Linux does "make install" add a systemd startup script, this will need to be added manually
on other systems if restart after reboot is required. (Or manually use the included hellod.init.sh)


Linux (with systemd)
=====
The basic install is:
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo service hellod start
  # Watch the pretty messages in /var/log/syslog
  sudo service hellod stop
  sudo make uninstall
And if you want to make it start automatically at boot:
  systemctl enable hellod


MacOS
=====
I've only ever had this running as a normal user, compiled against MacPorts.


FreeBSD
=======
FreeBSD requires gmake
I wrote a startup script: hello.freebsd
This used to get installed by:
  cp hellod.freebsd /etc/rc.d/hellod
and add to /etc/rc.conf:
  hellod_enable="YES"
When I tried this under FreeBSD 13, it no longer worked, so you're on your own!
