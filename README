This is a simple, but full, "hello world" example of a service.
It was written as a starting base for writing real services. Mostly for ham radio on Raspbian,
but as far as I'm aware there are no particular Raspbian-specific dependencies.

The file "main.c" handles the configuration files and command line options.
The file "core.c" is the routines for the service. For this example the loop() just prints the date/time.
"hellod.init.sh" is an old, initscripts, service script. By default, this is unused.
"hellod.service" is a new, systemd, service file. This is used by default.

To use:
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo service hellod start
  # Watch the pretty messages in /var/log/syslog
  sudo service hellod stop
  sudo make uninstall

TODO
  Debian package, "make deb"
  FreeBSD initscript.
  OpenWRT makefile.
  Test compatibility with pthreads.
