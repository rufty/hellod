This is a simple, but full, "hello world" example of a service.
It was written as a starting base for implementing real services. Mostly for ham radio on Raspbian,
but as far as I'm aware there are no particular Raspbian-specific dependencies.

The file "main.c" handles the configuration files and command line options.
The file "core.c" is the routines for the service. For this example the loop() just prints the date/time.
"hellod.service" is a new, systemd, service file. This is used by default.
"hellod.init.sh" is an old, initscripts, service script. By default, this is unused.
"hellod.freebsd" is a FreeBSD startup script.
See INSTALL for more info.

TODO
  Debian package, "make deb"
  OpenWRT makefile.
  Test compatibility with pthreads.
  Is a final, no-longer-background finish() needed???
